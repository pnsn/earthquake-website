<p>
	This web site is provided by the United States Geological Survey&#146;s
	(USGS) Earthquake Hazards Program as part of our effort to reduce earthquake
	hazard in the United States. We are part of the USGS Hazards Mission Area and
	are the USGS component of the congressionally established, multi-agency
	<a href="http://www.nehrp.gov/" target="_blank">National Earthquake Hazards
	Reduction Program (NEHRP)</a>.
</p>

<p>The USGS participates in the NEHRP with:
  <ul>
    <li>
      the <a href="http://www.fema.gov/">Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)</a>,
    </li>
    <li>
      the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/index.html">National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</a>,
    </li>
    <li
    and the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation (NSF)</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  In the 2004 reauthorization of NEHRP by Congress, NIST has been
	given the lead role to plan and coordinate this national effort to mitigate
	earthquake losses by developing and applying earth science data and
	assessments essential for land-use planning, engineering design, and
	emergency preparedness decisions.

<p>
	Earthquakes pose significant risk to 75 million Americans in 39 States. The
	USGS is the only Federal agency with responsibility for recording and
	reporting earthquake activity nationwide. Citizens, emergency responders, and
	engineers rely on the USGS for accurate and timely information on where an
	earthquake occurred, how much the ground shook in different locations, and
	what the likelihood is of future significant ground shaking.
</p>
<p>
  The USGS estimates that several million earthquakes occur in the world each
  year, but many go undetected because they occur in remote areas or have very
  small magnitudes. The USGS now locates about 50 earthquakes each day; 20,000
  a year.
</p>
<p>
	The USGS is working to improve its earthquake monitoring and reporting
	capabilities through the <a href="/monitoring/anss/"
	>Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS)</a>. In the past three years the
	USGS has installed approximately 300 new earthquake monitoring instruments in
	the San Francisco, Seattle, Salt Lake City, Anchorage, Reno, Las Vegas, and
	Memphis areas. Full implementation of ANSS will result in 6000 new
	instruments on the ground and in structures in at-risk urban areas, as well
	as a backbone of modern seismic instruments for the entire Nation. Once in
	place, the ANSS will provide emergency response personnel with real-time
	(within 5-10 minutes of an event) information on the intensity and
	distribution of ground shaking that can be used to guide emergency response
	efforts. Similarly, information on building &quot;shaking&quot; will equip
	engineers with the data they need to improve building designs in the future.
</p>
<h2>USGS External Earthquake Research Support</h2>
<p>
	In addition to activities performed by USGS staff, expertise in earthquake
	studies that exist outside the federal government is applied through a
	substantial program of grants, cooperative agreements and/or contracts with
	universities, state, regional and local government agencies, and private
	industry. The USGS invites research proposals to develop information,
	knowledge and methods that will assist in achieving the goals of the
	Earthquake Hazards Program.
